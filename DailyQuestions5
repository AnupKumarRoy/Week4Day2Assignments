1.Selenium:
  * It is an automation testing tool used to test web-based applications.
  * Components are Selenium IDE,RC,WebDriver and Grid.
 Selenium WebDriver:
    It is the most important tool of the Selenium suite.Because of many limitations 
    with RC,WebDriver was developed.
 2.Selenium communicate with the Web browser:
    i.Selenium Script create an HTTP request for each selenium command and sends it to the browser driver.
   ii.An HTTP request is then sent to the server using Browser Driver.
  iii.The steps are executed on the HTTP server.
   iv.The execution status is sent to the HTTP server which is then captured by the automation script.
 3.Locators to find the elements:
    They are id,name,className,tagName,link text,partial link text,CssSelector and xpath.
 4.ID is prefered than xpath:
    ID is considered as unique key so there cannot be more than 1 elements for same ID where xpath have 
    shows cases when we can get 2 or more elements for same xpath.
 5.Select value in dropDown:
    Step 1: Import the "Select" package.
    Step 2: Declare the dropdown elements as an instance of the Select class.
            Eg. Select drpCountry = new Select(path);
    Step 3: We can now start controlling "drpCountry" by using any of the available Select method to select dropdown
            in selenium.
 6.Absolute xpath: 
    It contains the complete path from the root element to the desire element.
   Relative xpath:
    This is more like starting simply by referencing the elements you want and go from the particular location.
 9.Syntax for preceding xpath:
    younger Cousin xpath/preceding::elder tag.
  Syntax for following xpath:
     Elder Cousin xpath/preceding::younger tag.
 10.To get an attributes value using selenium webDriver:
    i.To create path and convert to webElement.
   ii.Introduce a method getAttribute and send a argument to the method , arguments as attribute from path 
      and its return type is String.
  iii.print the attribute.
